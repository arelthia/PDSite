                    <p>Barbeque chicken wings are one of my favorite foods. Barbeque is a cooking method, a grilling device, a style of food, and a name for a meal or gathering at which this style of food is cooked and served. Depending on my mood I also like other dishes as well.</p>

                    <p>I watch these shows for their characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, directing, and writing. The dynamics between the characters adds to the excitementof the show.</p>
